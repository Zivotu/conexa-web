      question: "What is Conexa?",
      answer: "Conexa is a mobile-first platform that transforms everyday life in apartment buildings and their surrounding neighbourhoods. It provides tools for building management, resident communication, and community engagement all in one app."
    },
    {
      question: "Who can use Conexa?",
      answer: "Anyone living in an apartment building can use Conexa. Individual residents can use the free plan to access local marketplace and repair services. Buildings can upgrade to get full management features for all residents."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I manage multiple buildings?",
      answer: "Yes! Building administrators can manage multiple properties from one account. Each building has its own community, modules, and settings while sharing the same admin dashboard."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Conexa really free?",
      answer: "Yes, the Free Tenant plan is completely free forever and includes access to Marketplace and Home Repairs. Building plans start at $9/month with a 7-day free trial that requires no credit card."
    },
    {
      question: "Who creates a building on Conexa?",
      answer: "Any resident can create a building profile, but typically it's done by building administrators, property managers, or active community members. The person who creates it becomes the initial admin and can invite others."
    },
    {
      question: "Who decides which modules to activate?",
      answer: "Building admins choose which modules to activate, but they can also set up democratic voting for residents to decide together. Different modules can have different permission settings based on your building's needs."
    },
    {
      question: "What languages does Conexa support?",
      answer: "Currently, Conexa is available in English and Croatian. We're expanding to German, Italian, and Spanish in 2025. All modules support multi-language content from residents."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need technical skills to use Conexa?",
      answer: "Not at all! Conexa is designed for everyone, regardless of technical experience. The app guides you through setup with simple steps, and our support team is always available to help."
